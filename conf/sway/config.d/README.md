# More sway configuration

`~/.config/sway/config.d/` where `*.conf` is included by my sway config.
Thus this `README.md` is not read, even if I happened to carelessly
copy-paste it in.

* `autostart-communication.conf` - chat/communication apps I am expected to have
  open or at least check at times
* `autostart-fineid.conf` - Finnish electric identity card, that I also use as SSH key
* `autostart-utilities.conf` - general utilities, like `nm-applet` or VPN etc.
* `grimshot.conf` - screenshotting keybinds using `grimshot`
* `i3-selenized-dark.conf` - selenized dark colour scheme
* `keyboard.conf` - keyboard configuration
* `media.conf` - media key configuration and autostarts related to it
* `pointer-accel.conf` - pointer/mouse configuration, mainly setting acceleration
  profile to `flat`
* `README.md` - you are currently reading this :wink:
* `sedric.conf` - configuration specific to my laptop hostnamed `sedric`
* `swaybar.conf` - `swaybar` configuration
* `swayidle.conf` - `swayidle` configuration/autostart
* `wlsunset-kotka.conf` - `wlsunset` configuration/autostart for my hometown for when
  I happen to visit for longer period of time
* `wlsunset-lauttasaari.conf` - `wlsunset` configuration for my home neighbourhood
* `zz-floating.conf` - configures windows that should float. For some reason
  that is inherited from my `i3` config, it tells to put float rules above the
  last line, so it should be read last and `z` is the last letter of English
  alphabet so it will hopefully be read last.
