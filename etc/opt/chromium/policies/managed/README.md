## `aminda-extensions.json`

As I cannot separate the keys to multiple files I am forced to keep them in
one and separate by what the file does, `aminda-extensions.json` is unlikely
to overlap with someone else.

Changing `normal_installed` to `force_installed` would also prevent
uninstallation.

### [Silk - Privacy Pass Client for the browser](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ajhmfdgkijocedmfjonnpjfojldioehi)

- `ajhmfdgkijocedmfjonnpjfojldioehi`

Silk or Privacy Pass has a chance of decreasing the amount of captchas
especially from Cloudflare when "suspicious" traffic is detected.

To intentionally trigger it and what should be allowed in NoScript:

- https://captcha.website
- https://issuance.privacypass.cloudflare.com

### [DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bkdgflcldnnnapblkhphbgpggdiikppg)

- `bkdgflcldnnnapblkhphbgpggdiikppg`

Installed by default so Google won't be the default search engine, or that
would be the idea, but Chromium doesn't seem to allow that.

Additionally it's restricted only to `google.com` and `duckduckgo.com` domains
so it won't interfere with other extensions.

### [NoScript](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/doojmbjmlfjjnbmnoijecmcbfeoakpjm)

- `doojmbjmlfjjnbmnoijecmcbfeoakpjm`

**_Not actually installed by `aminda-extensions.json` anymore due to
self-reflection and deciding it's a bit much to push on unsuspecting family
members._**

Appears to make the internet much more pleasant and less distracting in 2024
eliminating the cookie banners and all, while not trusting lists generated by
other people.

### [Dark Reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh)

- `eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh`

As playing around with these policies and constantly removing the profile directory doesn't help my migraine.

### [Indiewiki Buddy](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fkagelmloambgokoeokbpihmgpkbgbfm)

- `fkagelmloambgokoeokbpihmgpkbgbfm`

I am spoilt by how nice Breezewiki is to use and wikis existing outside of
Fandom is good to be reminded about occassionally. And I just happened to stay
in not so hardened Chromium for a bit due to hardened Firefox being too much
for my task and there is no reason occassionally needed Chromium shouldn't be
tolerable for a few minutes.

### [Wayback Machine](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fpnmgdkabkmnadcjpehmlllkndpkmiak)

- `fpnmgdkabkmnadcjpehmlllkndpkmiak`

[web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org) saving and discovering.

### [Privacy Manager](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/giccehglhacakcfemddmfhdkahamfcmd)

- `giccehglhacakcfemddmfhdkahamfcmd`

Quick browser options and data removal on _startup_. Maybe beneficial if
incognito is disabled (which again is not great idea for quick guest access?)

### [Terms of Service; Didn't Read](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hjdoplcnndgiblooccencgcggcoihigg)

- `hjdoplcnndgiblooccencgcggcoihigg`

### [Fedora User Agent](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hojggiaghnldpcknpbciehjcaoafceil)

- `hojggiaghnldpcknpbciehjcaoafceil`

Communicates websites that Ubuntu isn't the only Linux distribution and makes
some offer rpm packages directly.

### [Chrome Remote Desktop](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/inomeogfingihgjfjlpeplalcfajhgai)

- `inomeogfingihgjfjlpeplalcfajhgai`

Remote support integrated to Chrome.

The additional component is:

- Debian: `https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/chrome-remote-desktop_current_amd64.deb`
- Others: _unsupported_

### [Bias Finder](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/jojjlkfeofgcjeanbpghcapjcccbakop)

Political bias of English language media sites powered by allsides.com

### [Snowflake](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mafpmfcccpbjnhfhjnllmmalhifmlcie)

- `mafpmfcccpbjnhfhjnllmmalhifmlcie`

Helps bridge traffic to Tor by looking like WebRTC call.

### [AdNauseam](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/adnauseam/mlojlfildnehdpnlmpkeiiglhhkofhpb)

- `mlojlfildnehdpnlmpkeiiglhhkofhpb`

Complementing PrivacyBadger with an adblocker so first profile runs have at
least something to block Malvertising now that I no longer enable NoScript out
of the box.

### [Bitwarden](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nngceckbapebfimnlniiiahkandclblb)

- `nngceckbapebfimnlniiiahkandclblb`

The password manager of my choice.

### [UpdateSWH](palihjnakafgffnompkdfgbgdbcagbko)

- `palihjnakafgffnompkdfgbgdbcagbko`

Adds a floating coloured button to source code forges reflecting the status
of it being in Software Heritage Archive and allows quick archiving requests
to be made.

### [Blank New Tab](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/blank-new-tab/pfbmpcgfjncjakgfpddijlbdpjnhnfem)

- `pfbmpcgfjncjakgfpddijlbdpjnhnfem`

Replaces new tab with `about:blank` bypassing excess Microsoft.

### [Privacy Badger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp)

- `pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp`

Configured to learn locally and also in incognito as opposed to only relying
on vendor list. Also not display the "Welcome to Privacy Badger screen".

### TODO/Inconsistencies

- I am not aware of any _New Tab Suspender_ equivalents, but it might be an
  integrated feature on some Chromiums.
- [Peertubeify doesn't support Chromium yet.](https://codeberg.org/Booteille/peertube-companion/issues/15)

## `brave-search.json`

Sets/forces the use of search.brave.com as a search engine.

## `disable-floc.json`

Disables floc or ad topics that are against privacy.

- https://start.duckduckgo.com/?q=google+floc+privacy+topics

## `disable-incognito.json`

Disables incognito mode. I don't recommend this.

## `doh-automatic.json`

If no DNS over HTTPS policy is used, this unlocks the setting. Enabling managed policies disable it by default.

Incompatible with any actual DoH policy.

## `doh-dns0.json`

Simply enables DNS-over-HTTPS with DNS0.eu. `automatic` means downgrade is
allowed (the system resolver is encrypted), `secure` would lock it.

## `doh-mullvad-base.json`

Enables DNS-over-HTTPS with Mullvad Base, which features ad, malware & tracker blocking.

- https://mullvad.net/en/help/dns-over-https-and-dns-over-tls#specifications

## `duckduckgo.json`

Sets/forces the use of start.duckduckgo.com as a search engine.

## `enable-ech-ocsp.json`

Enables encrypted client hello and OCSP (or CRL?) checks.

## `enable-home.json`

Enables home button by default.

## `force-incognito.json`

Forces incognito mode. I don't recommend this.

## `https-everywhere.json`

Enforces https and attempts to upgrade http to https.
