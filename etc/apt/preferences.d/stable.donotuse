### WARNING! DO NOT USE! ###

## This is based on my unstable file for Debian testing and
## https://wiki.debian.org/AptPreferences#Notes_from_JoshuaRodman

## The currently installed release of Debian is 9 stretch, OpenVZ is not
## compatible with 10 at least yet
#Package: *
#Pin: release a=stretch
#Pin-Priority: 900

## I don't want to get backports unless I especially request them
#Package: *
#Pin: release a=stretch-backports
#Pin-Priority: -1

## Debian 10 Buster is the new version and I don't want updates from it
## either without warning.
#Package: *
#Pin: release a=buster-backports
#Pin-Priority: -1

## Catch-all
#Package: *
#Pin: release o=Debian
#Pin-Priority: -10

# Problems:
## * This is unsupported by Debian and be a too easy recipe to Frankendebian
## * Debian Security is forgotten
## * a lot of other issues due to dark magic?
## * this is too scary for me to keep on the VPS so I rm:ed it and
##   buster.list
##    * this is also why everything is commented, so I cannot accidentally
##      install this anywhere.
