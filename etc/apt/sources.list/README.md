sources.list files for Ubuntu and Debian
========================================

The files have been named so they are easily to fetch with script,
`lsb_release -sr` returns release e.g. `14.04` or `testing` and
`lsb_release -rc` returns codename e.g. `jessie`.

`mirrors.ubuntu.com/mirrors.txt` and `httpredir.debian.org` are used so
the files work everywhere and the nearest mirrors are always used no matter
where you are.

Which script to use?
--------------------

* `install` for Ubuntu and Debian testing/unstable.
    * If you run `Ã¬nstall` on Debian Stable, sources.list will say
      `stable` and when new Debian becomes stable apt wants to
      upgrade to it directly and that can be dangerous.
* `install.debian` for not-rolling Debian.

Usage
-----

1. Become root with `sudo su -`
2. Download the script either with either of the following):
    1. Ubuntu/Debian testing/unstable:
       `curl -L http://git.io/vqhtJ > sources.list.install`
    2. Debian: `curl -L http://git.io/vqhtF > sources.list.install`
3. `chmod +x sources.list.install`
4. `./sources.list.install`
5. *optionally* `sources.list.install`
