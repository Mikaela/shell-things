# Uncomment to disable IPv4
#ClientUseIPv4 0

# Allow Tor to connect to relay/bridge over IPv6. As the default is
# IPv4-only, this may cause less anonymity if the guard is bad (and
# especially if you are behind CGN?)

# Always prefer IPv6 over IPv4 (see previous), maybe this would be useful
# in a DS network preventing Tor over IPv4.
