# yum/dnf repositories

This directory is still read by `dnf` and contains files for repositories
that I appear to end up adding on every system that aren't as clear to add
as the links below.

## Additional repositories

- Begin by `sudo fedora-third-party enable`
- `sudo dnf copr enable neilalexander/yggdrasil-go`
  - https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/installation-linux-rpm.html
