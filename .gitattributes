# WARNING: In the unlikely scenario of checkout within Windows, copy to
# Linux, all line endings will be Windows clrf instead of lf as lf files
# aren't spoecified otherwise due to this repo mostly being config files.
# My repos are mostly incompatible with Windows anyway due to
# case-insensitive files anyway.
* text=auto
# These files are forced to be Windows when checked out. Think of WSL?
