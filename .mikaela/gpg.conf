# Unless you specify which option file to use (with the command line

# An options file can contain any long options which are available in
# GnuPG. If the first non white space character of a line is a '#',
# this line is ignored.  Empty lines are also ignored.

# See the man page for a list of options.

# Use my key by default, trusted-key puts it to ultimate trust even if the
# private key is not present and default-recepient-self is not enough for
# gpg --encrypt -r
# default-key/encrypt-to take name according to `man gpg`
#   NOTE! default-key is used instead of local-user as the latter cannot be
#   overridden with flags (causing WTOP test to be signed with personal and
#   WTOP keys)

# if auto-key-lookup is used, this tells the recepient which WKD to check?

# The defaults are apparently self-sigs-only,import-clean starting from
# gpg 2.2.17, but there seem to be controversial views on them and I need
# some not-self-sigs with `--fetch-keys`
# Debian uses self-sigs-only (while I would be fine with import-clean)

# I refuse to comment on GPG's weird scale how I have verified keys as

# Trust On First Use (marginal trust) with WoT being full trust. I find this
# less annoying in KMail than only WoT or the comment below, and I think it
# may be additional motivation for me to actually sign the keys I trust with
# all keyservers hiding signatures and gpg not importing them.
# I think `keybase pgp pull` also helps here as the people I am tracking
# there are going to be in my keyring, however it's still a centralized
# service.
