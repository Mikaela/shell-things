# Unless you specify which option file to use (with the command line

# by default.

# An options file can contain any long options which are available in
# GnuPG. If the first non white space character of a line is a '#',
# this line is ignored.  Empty lines are also ignored.

# See the man page for a list of options.

# The defaults are apparently self-sigs-only,import-clean starting from
# gpg 2.2.17, but there seem to be controversial views on them and I need
# some not-self-sigs with `--fetch-keys`
# Debian uses self-sigs-only (while I would be fine with import-clean)

# I don't think there is point in "encrypt-to 0xOWNKEYID, because there
# is the default-recipient-self above.

# Use UTF-8 charset

# use GPG Agent to avoid retyping passphrase very often.

# I refuse to comment on GPG's weird scale how I have verified keys as
#  I appear to disagree on the official meanings of 1-3.
#  If I sign a key, I have verified it to best of my ability. Also
#  apparently it doesn't have much meaning anyway https://debian-administration.org/users/dkg/weblog/98

# when outputting certificates, view user IDs distinctly from keys:
fixed-list-mode
# You should always know at a glance which User IDs gpg thinks are legitimately bound to the keys in your keyring:

list-options show-uid-validity

# Disable comments
no-comments

# Don't output version, small chance of having people put same keys on IPFS
no-emit-version

# Trust On First Use (marginal trust) with WoT being full trust. I find this
# less annoying in KMail than only WoT or the comment below, and I think it
# may be additional motivation for me to actually sign the keys I trust with
# all keyservers hiding signatures and gpg not importing them.
# I think `keybase pgp pull` also helps here as the people I am tracking
# there are going to be in my keyring, however it's still a centralized
# service.
