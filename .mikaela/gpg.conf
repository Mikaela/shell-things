# Unless you specify which option file to use (with the command line

# by default.

# An options file can contain any long options which are available in
# GnuPG. If the first non white space character of a line is a '#',
# this line is ignored.  Empty lines are also ignored.
#
# See the man page for a list of options.

# Use my key by default
default-key 0x99392F62BAE30723
# WTOP
#default-key 0xDC189FE6FA9BD685

# Ignore preferred keyserver
keyserver-options no-honor-keyserver-url
# The defaults are apparently self-sigs-only,import-clean starting from
# gpg 2.2.17, but there seem to be controversial views on them and I am
# not sure what way to go, so I am opting to trust the distribution.
# Debian uses self-sigs-only (while I would be fine with import-clean)
#  * https://dev.gnupg.org/T4628#128513
# Arch Linux reverts the change going by no-self-sigs-only,no-import-clean

# Try to automatically find keys from local/wkd if key for email address isn't found, but we are encrypting to email address.
auto-key-retrieve
auto-key-locate local,wkd


# Encrypt to sender's key by default
default-recipient-self

# I don't think there is point in "encrypt-to 0xOWNKEYID, because there
# is the default-recipient-self above.

# Use UTF-8 charset
charset UTF-8
display-charset utf-8

# use GPG Agent to avoid retyping passphrase very often.
use-agent

# Do everything in ASCII format by default instead of binary
armor

# Show the LONG KEYID and fingerprint by default and tell that it's hexadecimal string.
keyid-format 0xLONG

with-wkd-hash

# Ask everything

ask-cert-expire

# when outputting certificates, view user IDs distinctly from keys:
fixed-list-mode
# You should always know at a glance which User IDs gpg thinks are legitimately bound to the keys in your keyring:
verify-options show-uid-validity
list-options show-uid-validity

# Disable comments
no-comments

# Don't output version, small chance of having people put same keys on IPFS
no-emit-version

# Trust On First Use (marginal trust) with WoT being full trust. I find this
# less annoying in KMail than only WoT or the comment below, and I think it
# may be additional motivation for me to actually sign the keys I trust with
# all keyservers hiding signatures and gpg not importing them.
# I think `keybase pgp pull` also helps here as the people I am tracking
# there are going to be in my keyring, however it's still a centralized
# service.

# WoT with TOFUâ€™s conflict detection, but without positive trust
