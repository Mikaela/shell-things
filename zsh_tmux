# Different ways to start tmux on zsh startup.

# Starts tmux always on start of zsh, not only on SSH login, and quits from bash when tmux quits. (Modified from Cubox's script and William Shallum's tmux on SSH login http://william.shallum.net/random-notes/automatically-start-tmux-on-ssh-login )
#if [[ $TERM != "screen" ]]
#then
#   tmux has-session -t 0 && tmux attach-session -t 0 || tmux new-session -s 0 && exit
#fi

# Starts tmux on SSH login. (From http://william.shallum.net/random-notes/automatically-start-tmux-on-ssh-login )
# I personally think that this is more suitable for me than that which I made. TIP: replace "0" with name of computer if you don't ever have direct (physical) access to computer where zsh is running on.
