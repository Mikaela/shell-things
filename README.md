# What is this?

This is collection of files which I prefer to have everywhere.

## Where does the name "shell-things" come from? / History

In the beginning this repository was only GitHub gist and contained only two files,
bashrc. Then I moved to zsh and abandoned .bashrc. Some time after that I got need for
having both files so I merged them into shell-things. At some point there came many
other files from which some aren't related to shells, but I don't want to rename it.

## How do I use this?

Just read the files and copy-paste some things which you need. Be aware that there are
things which you want to remove like my name in pastebinit.xml and gpg.conf and .gitconfig and gpg.conf encrypts to me by default etc.

## Can I share this

Yes. If you take something from these files, you can freely redistribute it even without mentioning the source.  I am trying to mention original sources in these files.
