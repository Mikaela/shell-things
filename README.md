# What is this?

This is collection of files which I prefer to have everywhere.

## Where does the name "shell-things" come from? / History

In the beginning this repository was only GitHub gist and contained only two files,
bashrc. Then I moved to zsh and abandoned .bashrc. Some time after that I got need for
having both files so I merged them into shell-things. At some point there came many
other files from which some aren't related to shells, but I don't want to rename it.

## How do I use this?

Just read the files and copy-paste some things which you need or run the install.run file.

```
./install.run
```

<b>WARNING: install.run CAN CAUSE DATA LOSS BY OVERWRITING EVERYTHING WHAT IT ADDS!</b>

## Can I share this

Yes. If you take something from these files, you can freely redistribute it even without mentioning the source.  I am trying to mention original sources in these files.

## What are .MKAYSIGREP.md and MKAYSIGREP.html and .*.MKAYSIGREP?

They are just cheatsheet for me what do I copy to .custom or .environment or .aliases
or whatever. Their content can be found from all files, but commented and without 
proper configuration they can cause unwanted effects.
