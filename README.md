Config files that I wish to have everywhere. You could probably call this
repository as dotfiles, but historical reasons...

Directories explained
=====================

* .mikaela — files that most likely aren't suitable for places where other
  people than me have access too
* Windows — files releated to Windows
* conf — config files like .tmux.conf
* etc — /etc/
* gpg — GNU Privacy Guard config files, ~/.gnupg/
* rc — bashrc, zshrc, vimrc and apparently \*init files…
