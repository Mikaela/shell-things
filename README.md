# shell-things

This is repository for important files, which I prefer to have everywhere.

## What is what

### root

.cat.sh — script which puts (almost) everything on it's correct place. *WARNING:* It will *overwrite* the current versions of those files if they exist. That is why it's hidden (dot)file.

.gitignore — list of files, which git shouldn't add to this repository.

bashrc — Bourne Again SHell config file

gitconfig — git config file

notMkaysi — file which can be pasted to ~/.custom to evade some things, which can be annoyances for others than me.

pastebinit.xml — pastebinit config file

vimrc — ViIMproved config file

xsessionrc — what is executed on X logon

oidentd.conf — configuration file for Oidentd

tmux.conf — configuration file for Tmux terminal multiplexer.

warnings — script, which suggests Debian packages, which files in this repository think you should have

zshrc — The Z SHell config file

### gnupg/ — GnuPG related config files

gpg.conf — GnuPG config file

pgprules.xml.asc — *ENCRYPTED* Enigmail Per-Recepient rules.
